# Databox

The Databox platform. See http://www.databoxproject.uk/ for more information

## Installation

All Databox components, including the container manager, run in Docker
containers. So,
first [install and run Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker), and
then
[install `docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).

## Operation

Once docker is installed, just run the following to get your databox up and
running using images published to <https://hub.docker.com/r/databoxsystems>:

    ./startDatabox.sh

Once it's started point a web browser at <https://127.0.0.1:8989> and have fun.

To stop databox and clean up,

    ./stopDatabox.sh

## Development

To develop on the platform and core components run

    ./startDatabox.sh dev

This will clones all the relevant repositories locally, and builds them into the
required Docker images. To try your component out, add your code into a
directory with a Databox manifest and `Dockerfile`, and then add a reference to
it in `docker-compose-dev-local-images.yaml`. Your image will then be built
alongside the platform. To install your app, upload the manifest to the local
app store on <http://127.0.0.1:8181> and it should then become visible in the
UI, ready for you to install.

## Known issues

- Error response from daemon: `network databox_[some network] not found`.

  This is caused by starting Databox before docker has cleaned up the networks.
  Should be fixed if you run `./startDatabox.sh`

- TLS certificates invalid.

  In some cases, the time in docker containers on Mac can get out of sync with
  the system clock. This causes the HTTPS certs generated by the CM from being
  valid. See <https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/17>. Fix by restarting
  Docker for Mac.
